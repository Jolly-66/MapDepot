# Skyrats Central Command Dock
The End of Round Shuttle dock was updated per Host Request, to be less of a big "fuck around and find out" area to a "peaceful conclusion" to the round.

This eventually turned into an AutoMapper template! Which is fancy Skyrat lingo for "this map gets pasted onto /tg/s map during initialization"!
